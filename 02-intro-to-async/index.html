        * What is async
          * visual demo of the event loop

          * Concurrency model comparison
            * Multi threading

          * Javascript concurrency model
            * Single Threaded


        * Why callbacks?
          * How it works
          * try/catch with callbacks. `try { setTimeout(x, 0) } catch (e) { console.log('caught') }`
          * Callback hell
        * Promises
          * An abstraction around async work giving us access to “future” values.
            * A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
          * Creating promises
          * Promise methods (Promise.all, etc)
            * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
            * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises
          * Composition/chaining of promises
          * When not to use them
            * If you're doing synchronous work
            * In place of events that occur numerous times
            * When you have a callback situation where the callback is designed to be called multiple times
            * For situations where the action often does not finish or occur: This is just inefficient memory usage and is probably better served by some sort of event notification

          ## About Me

          - Frontend Engineer / Technical Lead @ Canva
          - Graduated UNSW in 2016 (Computer Science)
          - COMP2041 student in 2014
          - COMP2041 tutor in 2015

          Note:
          I think it's worthwhile giving some context about why I'm here today giving this lecture;

          - I'm actually a UNSW graduate who took COMP2041 in 2014 and tutored it in 2015.
          - The course seems to have changed a lot since then and
          - I am really liking the direction it's taking.
          - After graduating UNSW I applied to Canva for a Frontend Engineering role.
          - Canva is a web-based graphic design tool,
          - so you could imagine there is a lot of frontend work to be done

          And that's about it! It'd like to thank you all for having me here and a special thanks to Andrew Taylor
          and Alex Hinds for giving me this opportunity to present this content here today.

          If you have any questions I'll be hanging around for a little bit, or alternatively send me an email or tweet
          me.

          If web development is something that you are passionate about, I highly recommend you apply for our summer intern
          program or if you are graduating this year, our graduate program. Once again, I'm happy to chat now in
          person, or feel free to send me an email with your resume and details and I'll forward it onto our
          recruitment team.
